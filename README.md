#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

This project includes adapting an existing project template for different screen sizes, finishing MapBox integration, Service Worker for files caching and accessibility features.

Original template includes two pages: main page with restaurant list and a restaurant details page.

## Changes

* Added MapBox API key for displaying maps
* Updates CSS to make main page and restaurant details look better
* Restaurant list CSS changes to allow several items per line (if screen size allows)
* Map moved under restaurant summary and before reviews in restaurant details page
* Responsive design elements added using media query
* Tested tab index of all elements (appear to be in order in the original template)
* Added alt-description to all image elements
* Added Service Worker to cache application files as well as images and JSON with restaurant info
